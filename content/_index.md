I am a researcher working in __Internet measurements__ at the intersection between __Deep Learning__, __BigData__, and __data-plane programming__. Currently, I am a Principal Engineer working in AI4NET Datacom lab lead by Dario Rossi, at the Huawei Research center in Paris (France), and I focus on the integration of Deep Learning into traffic monitoring systems, targeting __continuous learning__ and __network automation__. 

Previously, I was an associate researcher at Telefonica Research, and a Principal Engineer at Telefonica UK/O2, where I designed and deployed an ML product to predict daily customer satisfaction for 30M+ O2 customers using a variety of live network logs.

I am a researcher working in *Internet measurements* at the intersection between *Deep Learning*, *BigData* and *data-plane programming*. Currently, I am a Principal Engineer working at the Huawei [AI4NET Datacom lab](https://ai4netlab.github.io) in Paris (France) focusing on the integration of Deep Learning into traffic monitoring systems for *continuous learning* and *network automation*. 

Previously, I was a research associate at Telefonica Research, and a Principal Engineer at Telefonica UK/O2, where I designed and deployed in production an ML product to predict daily customer satisfaction for 30M+ O2 customers using a variety of live network logs.

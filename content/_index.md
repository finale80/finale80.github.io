I am a researcher working in *Internet measurements* at the intersection between *Deep Learning*, *BigData* and *data-plane programming*. Currently, I am a Principal Engineer working in AI4NET Datacom lab lead by Dario Rossi, at the Huawei Research center in Paris (France), and I focus on the integration of Deep Learning into traffic monitoring systems, targeting *continuous learning* and *network automation*. 

Previously, I was a research associate at Telefonica Research, and a Principal Engineer at Telefonica UK/O2, where I designed and deployed an ML product to predict daily customer satisfaction for 30M+ O2 customers using a variety of live network logs.

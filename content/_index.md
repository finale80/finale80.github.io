I am currently a Principal Engineer at the HUAWEI research center in Paris. Before, I was as Researcher at Telefonica Research, and a Principal Engineer at Telefonica UK/O2. 

My research interests are at the intersection between BigData and Deep Learning with application to computer networks. At HUAWEI I am part of a team investigating how to integrate AI with data-plane programming to empower network monitoring and distributed telemetry systems.
